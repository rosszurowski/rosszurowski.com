I want to talk about _outlets_, and their use as a creative tool.

The term is often used as an easy expression, conjuring up an image of a mother frustrated by her children's antics ("she just needs an outlet for her energy!"). I'd like to repurpose the it. I've found outlets to be a helpful metaphor for understanding what makes up a healthy and curious life, for mothers and children alike. I'll try to describe the concept in detail here.

---

An outlet is **a pre-defined venue for effort**.[^creativity]

It's a home for intentional work. A job, a project, a club, a company; all of these are outlets. But outlets aren't necessarily a socially constructed space, they can also be an object like a journal or a notebook.

The word outlet comes from an opening for a river, letting water out into a larger body. From the days of the muses and creation myths, Water has long been a metaphor for creativity, so the expression seems fitting.

Outlets are closely tied to the idea of publishing, but it doesn't mean all outlets are public. A journal is a good example of an outlet that stays private. The important quality of an outlet is that it's a destination that's different than the space where something is created, regardless of where that  destination is.

Outlets have three notable properties that make them so important: they *draw work out of you*, they *shape that work*, and *they focus the world* around the work.

![A test](./river-g.jpg)

### A Question

* a question potentially confuses my point with the idea of a prompt, a framing of a topic when I want to refer more directly to how a question "activates" a space and draws something out of it.

Growing up, my siblings and I travelled around with our dad a lot. We'd go for road trips across Western Canada and the Northern United States. We'd drive through the Canadian prairies for long stretches and visit our grandparents in Calgary. We'd pop across the border to see parks like Devil's Peak or Yellowstone, and make our way back into Canada through the Rocky Mountains. I loved those trips.

As we travelled around we'd make pit stops in gas stations or park offices my dad would spark

Something about his "I-grew-up-hunting-gophers-and-now-I'm-a-mining-engineer" eagerness 

In learning about the craft of user research and watching professional researchers do interviews or (eeek) having to conduct them myself, I noticed the same thing. A interested, talented group of experts and business owners and academics can be together in the same room and stay completely silent. People have a surprising capacity to sit around awkwardly or sputter through a conversation on weather or politics.

But as soon as the right question gets asked, "", you'd never know what you were in for. All it takes is one good question to frame a topic and spark a conversation.

So the idea that an outlet is just a destination, a place to put something might sound innocuous, but having a place to put things is important. Having a place to put creative work gives you a _reason_ to make creative work. An outlet isn't just an empty place on a shelf that might need to be filled, but actively draws work out of you.

An Instagram account is a common example. People have been casually snapping photos ever since the early 1900s with the advent of the $1 Kodak Brownie camera and the first cheap commercial films. But the "outlet" for these photos was usually the family photo album. By the 1950s it was estimated that 55% of all photos that were even taken were of babies. In this way, the camera would come out at special occasions: birthdays, holidays, family vacations.

Now, with Instagram as an outlet, millions of people who would otherwise be uninterested in photography are actively engaged in the culture around it. 150 million photos are taken each year, more than ever before in history. By having an Instagram account, the photography is literally _drawn out of you_ like a plant pulling water up through its roots.

I had an image of prolific writers and artists as people who, in some Platonic sense, were simply "creative." Inspired by some internal vision of what the world needed, they'd write essays, draw pictures, paint paintings. They'd produce more and more of these things until there was enough for a book or a gallery exhibition.

While, in some senses, I suppose that's true, my view has shifted. There's an inversion of the thinking: "people have work to share, so they make a place to put it" more often than not, is actually "I have a place to put work, I'm going to make work to fill it."

There's always something to write about. There's always a situation to design for. 

Outlets aren't just a destination. In many ways, they're also a starting place.


Imagine a hobby you've been doing for many years. Now, imagine someone asked you to teach a class about it. All of a sudden you have a space to fill, a reason to reflect on your experiences, and a pedagogy to develop.

People started a blog and after a few years, they find that it's their main gig. Their life has grown around the outlet they've made.

Water needs to flow somewhere, otherwise it sits still and grows stagnant.

A blog is an easy example. I'm always amazed at how much friends of mine know, but without a place to put it, it often stays locked up inside their head. A blog is like an open tap — all the ideas floating around in your head finally have a place to land on their own. Not tied into other projects, but in their own right.

    * Draw the work out: Outlets aren't just a destination. In many ways, they're also a starting place.
        * It draws the work out
        * Instagram account example
        * Defining the context or the user fills the space
        * Morning pages


A better image would be that of a plant, whose roots draw up water from the soil below. We are the soil, and our outlets are the plants.

Want to make more of a certain kind of work? Make a dedicated space to publish it! People who have a place to publish photos will take more photos than those who don't. People who have a place to publish writing will write more.

An open invitation or opportunity to make something.

### A Bowl

> _What is it that makes a bowl useful?_<br />
> A bowl can carry things, and we can eat or drink out of it.<br />
> _So we like a bowl because it provides us with other things?_<br />
> Well, no. A bowl doesn't actually provide anything that<br />we don't first provide to the bowl.<br />
> _And the things we provide to the bowl are<br />all that we like about the bowl?_<br />
> Well, no. A bowl is empty, capable of holding things.<br />
> _So we like a bowl because of what is not there?<br />Because the middle of a bowl is not bowl?_<br />
> Yes. We like a bowl because of what is not there.

When speaking of what I'd call an outlets, friends of mine will often use the word "opportunity." A friend who's a tattoo artist will talk about the opportunity she got to design a tattoo for a famous ballet dancer. An old friend finally started his own branding studio and is making all kinds of opportunities for himself.

I heard once that the root for the word "opportunity" comes from a Latin word "pore", meaning an opening. Same as the pores in your skin. Not only do open spaces draw something out from us, but they also have their own influence on what we fill them with.

Returning to the Instagram example, not only are more photos taken, but more photos of a certain type are taken.

but having a singular venue for their photos refine the kinds of photos they take, optimizing their photos for the small screens of phones.[^1]

Each outlet over time can gain a character. Flickr was chock full of HDR and landscape images, 500px came to supersede that.



The destination of the work _inspires_ and _shapes_ what you make. That's why it's more than just a destination. When used intentionally, it can actually be a creative tool.


It's an opening or kind of [framework](https://shapeofdesignbook.com/chapters/03-improvisation-and-limitations/) that draws something out of a space.

### A Wakening

In high school, several of my friends got interested in lucid dreaming, the practice of dreaming while you're aware of it. Inspired by the film, _The Waking Life_, they'd experiment with all sorts of ways to achieve a lucid dream state. 

One of them, having lived in Africa for a few years when he was younger knew that the easiest way to have a waking dream was _mefloquine_, a malaria medication. However, with mefloquine being replaced by drugs without side-effects (and as students with no plans to go to any sub-tropical country), getting a prescription wasn't going to happen.

Barring medication, the next best thing was keeping a dream journal.

To lucid dream you need to be able to recognize that you're in a dream while it's happening. You have notice where you are. Normally your brain forgets dreams within a few minutes of waking up. And I suppose after a lifetime of ignoring dreams, your brain gets good at forgetting about them.

So to counter-act this, lucid dreamers keep a dream journal where each morning they write down what they dreamt about last night. It starts out difficult. You struggle to recall basic details like where you were, or how many dreams you had. But over time it gets easier and easier.

It's a practice of nudging your brain saying, "hey you, brain, this is important stuff, don't forget it." And your brain picks up on that.

I love this idea because it seems true for so many things.

As a graphic designer, so much of design school felt like the same process. Assignment after assignment helping you to say, "hey, eyes, look out for the odd blobs of whitespace in this poster/typeface/book layout. It's important stuff, don't forget it."



That's the third important quality of outlets, that they **focus the world around you**, and help you notice things. Snippets of conversation turn into story ideas; odd situations in your work life turn into the syllabus. Having an outlet focuses everyday life into a discrete output.

In a sense, the best way to get better at a certain kind of work seems to be to craft your own outlet for it.

People who produce the most interesting work are often the product of the diversity of their outlets.



After all, making exposes you to the [adjacent possibles](https://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/09/28/the-adjacent-possible.html) in any field, so choosing your outlets determines the futures you're working towards.

### Designing Outlets

Creating an effective place for creative work to realize itself is almost more work than the work itself.

Just as there's an art to asking a good question or making a good bowl, there's an art to crafting good outlets.

### Where outlets come from

> We lose that life which remains unarticulated.<br />
> — Lewis Hyde, _The Gift_

> If you bring forth what is inside of you, what you bring forth will save you. If you don’t bring forth what is inside of you, what you bring forth can destroy you.
> — Anne Lamott, _Bird by Bird_

For most people, I'd guess that many outlets in our life are made by others:

* A literature club at school that publishes a magazine gives you an outlet to explore printing techniques, page design methods, .
* A project at work gives you an outlet to practice
* A friend starting a business who needs branding work done.

When those outlets disappear (for whatever reason), it leaves a gap in what we make. If you're like me, the disappearance of those outlets trickles into how you feel about yourself.

For myself, graduating design school in 2016 meant the loss of many outlets. In school, I'd have classes on topics I really enjoy, but otherwise sit at the periphery of my interests: type design, branding, communication design. The visual focus of those classes also gave me a chance to explore all sorts of media: calligraphy, laser cutting, suminagashi marbling, screen printing, origami, etc.

These days, my work is heavily software-focused, concerned more with architecture than appearance, structure rather than style. I love it, but I also miss the artistic exploration of those classes. As much as I enjoyed my school's type design classes, without any outlet to draw the work out of me, I haven't once opened up a font editor in the 3 years since school has ended. In fact, doing a Masters' degree sounds compelling to me for this reason — it's a chance to once again explore a set of outlets that I've only found in a school setting.

I'm hardly limited to these things. Nothing stops me from sitting down and cranking out a new typeface (other than a sense of perfectionism, perhaps). But without having a place to publish it to, with nothing drawing that kind of work out of me, it disappears.

Perhaps because outlets are a certain kind of framework. An outlet is a context that work needs to fit into. It provides a structure of what's allowed and what isn't, narrowing the range of possible options to something more manageable, like a prompt.

But especially in our first twenty years of life, so many outlets are given to us that it's easy to forget there's a craft to making our own.

### Making outlets for others

If it's true that having the effective outlets is as important as the work itself, it's worth some time to examine the craft of producing good ones.

While it's easy to open an Instagram account or YouTube channel, it takes skill to know where and when an outlet is needed, and how to frame it in productive ways.

As my friends and I of mine look to create our own outlets of various shapes and sizes, it's interesting to see what tends to work and what doesn't:

* Hooking into an existing structures (communities) is much easier. Finding a job, joining up with an existing community. Creating your own structures (company, community) is much harder. The latter, however often gives you more freedom and feels more meaningful.
* Name your outlets! Often times, even the act of giving a name to a set of experiments is enough to form it into an outlet. Sometimes, simply registering a domain and naming a project can be enough of a push to formalize the outlet and make it happen. But don't get caught up in it.

As vague as the term "outlet" can be, it feels important to articulate. Because when you articulate the idea, you can begin to study them. Are they good ones? Bad ones? Are they given to us? Or are there some still missing that we need to make for ourselves?

[^creativity]: People often think in terms of "creative work," which I think is a dangerous concept with a lot of baggage. I subscribe to the idea that “art is anything that’s better than it needs to be,” so a destination for "effort" seems appropriately less constraining than one for "creative work" one in my mind.
[^1]: \*cleverly steers away from oft-written commentary on how Instagram is influencing contemporary photographic culture\*
[^2]: Prompts and outlets share many qualities, but a prompt is more of a conceptual framework rather than a destination.

<!--

* Nature of an outlet
    * A place/venue to put creative output. A destination.
        * A job, a project, a club, a company. All these are outlets.
        * Journal or a notebook, an object that asks to be filled
        * A class or a lecture is a powerful outlet to summarize what you've learned and revisit it in ways that you can share with others
        * Closely tied with publishing, but not necessarily public. More about having a distinct space, context of use, reader, destination.
    * The word comes from an opening for a river, letting water out into a larger body.
        * Water has long been a metaphor for creativity, from the days of the muses [fact check], so the expression seems fitting. Water needs somewhere to flow to, otherwise it sits still and grows stagnant.
    * Outlets have three important qualities
        * They draw out the work
        * They focus the work
        * They shape the work
    * Draw the work out: Outlets aren't just a destination. In many ways, they're also a starting place.
        * "People are making work so they need a place to put things" becomes "I have a place to put things, so I'm going to make work to fill it"
        * If someone asks you to teach a class on a subject you're an expert at, all of a sudden you have a space to fill, and a reason to reflect on it
        * It's like how a good question can draw an interesting conversation out of a group of strangers
        * It draws the work out
        * Instagram account example
        * Defining the context or the user fills the space
        * Morning pages
    * Shape the work: Sometimes I hear people use another word when talking about outlets: "opportunity"
        * I learned a few years back, opportunity comes from the root word for "_pore_", the same root for the pores in your skin. It's an opening.
        * Opportunity, pore, an opening, an outlet is like that.
        * Like a bowl, it asks to be filled
        * It also shapes what's inside of it
        * It shapes the work
        * What works on Instagram is what gets posted on Instagram. The medium/outlet impacts the production.
        * Contrast with Flickr or 500px or Tumblr
    * Focus the work:
        * In high school, friends got interested in lucid dreaming (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waking_Life), dreaming while you're aware of it
        * Barring some forms of malaria medication, it's hard to achieve the state, but one of the most reliable techniques is a dream journal 
        * (explain a dream journal)
            * By writing about dreams, you tell your brain "hey man, this is important" and it begins to pick up on that.
            * You get better at remembering, at noticing.
        * The same is true for photographers. Or any other craft of doing something consistently.
        * Having an outlet _focuses_ the world around you. vague snippets turn into story ideas; odd work situations transform into a part of a syllabus. Outlets focus everyday life into concrete output.
    * Meta-work:
        * If the outlet shapes the quantity and qualities of the work, then designing the right one is important.
            * Toyota and designing the process of making things
            * Elon Musk, designing the factory is the work
        * Reflecting on what kinds of outlets we have can change the kind of work we do.
    * Other more subtle outlets
        * Daily projects (365, UI a day, poetry a day)
        * Friends, communities are emotional outlets
        * Close-knit communities need (at least) three forms of outlets
* The craft of outlets
    * Loss of outlets over time; gaining of outlets over time.
        * Me losing my outlets for type design and visual design after graduating from design school.
    * When you want to do a certain kind of work, you often need to create your own outlet
        * Me learning to code to build the websites I'd design
        * Matt Damon writing his own script to act in for _Good Will Hunting_
    * The most prolific creative folks always construct their own outlets
        * Frank Chimero writing a blog, which turned into a series of essays, which turned into a book
        * Bobby Giangeruso starting all sorts of companies to practice his product skills
        * Donald Glover and his music, acting, and writing, then tying the outlets together. Must have some career-spanning satisfaction to tie several long-running projects together like that.
    * It's easy to hop onto existing outlets; there's value in making your own (convenience ← → freedom tradeoff)
    * Lessons on designing outlets
        * I'm hardly an expert; practices like management, user research, architecture are whole disciplines dedicated to designing effective outlets
        * A few thoughts
            * Be conscious of how many outlets you can handle. I like to lean towards having enough time to be generous with each, but some people can't work unless they have 3 things on the go.
            * Name your outlets. Don't get caught up in it, but a name can sometimes imbue a vague idea with enough cohesiveness to become a distinct venue.
                * A musician (eg. Com Truise) playing around with sounds, then picking a name to tie them together into a cohesive piece.
            * Keep them focused. Especially when you're just starting. Like a prompt or a framework, a vague outlet is an unhelpful one. They can always grow over time if needed.
            * Be committed to your outlets. Those who pick something and do it are a lot further along than those who sit wondering where to begin.
    * Meta-note: designing outlets for others
        * Making a community to scratch their own itch
        * Starting a company to work with friends
        * "the most meaningful human activities often boils down to providing…"
    * Alongside others like process and form, outlets are a core principle for thinking about an engaged, curious life.
    * Keep it flowing

"an outlet for his energy"
"a channel or a conduit"

* outlets as a tool for doing creative work
* having a place for creativity to realize itself is almost more of the work than "being creative." Creating a space for yourself or others to be creative cultivates a creative spirit. Start a personal project, a blog, a community art group, etc.
* an outlet is like a question, it draws out an answer from an otherwise uninteresting space. it promotes a curiosity
* "a forcing function"
* plants and roots drawing water up out of the soil, capillary action
* examples of outlets
    * markets are a great outlet (I have no interest in selling something, instagram, bandcamp, youtube)
    * communities of people working on projects (dream machine, learning gardens, are.na community, p2p web community, open source community, renga, a personal site)
    * an event, a concert
    * an app, an ongoing project
    * a team, a job
    * an invitation to speak at a conference, teach a class
    * tumblr is an outlet, an outlet for curation and vibe collection
    * meetings at a start-up, fears or issues about a project, having the right meeting to draw those out can change things
    * musicians, idly jamming until themes emerge, and it forms into an album. the album and theme behind the album is the focusing outlet that draws it into a cohesive whole
    * Craig Mod's _Koya Bound_
* kinds of outlets
    * social (a community, a meeting, a friendship)
    * temporal (an event, a concert, a weekly jam session)
    * conceptual (a prompt, an idea)
    * physical (a sketchbook)
* some outlets are self-made, some are made by others
    * many are provided for us, or come to us
        * a club at school
        * a project at work
        * a friend starting a business
    * it's easy to forget that there's a craft to making our own
* having a place to put something draws it out of you
* people who have a place to publish photos… will take more photos
* people who have a place to write… will finish more pieces of writing
* people who have others to cook for… will tend to cook more
* people who are writing a book, you have a place to put ideas about a topic
* even a friendship can be an outlet, albeit an ever-changing one. an emotional outlet, but also a topical outlet (i talk about starting a business with jared)
* "what you don't express will destroy you"
* leaving school and losing various outlets was hard
    * i lost an outlet for print design, type design, cultural studies
    * this is why doing a masters degree is so compelling, it's a chance to restore once lost outlets
* an outlet is a focused space that requests something of you
* an outlet is limited, it's a playground you move within, it shouldn't be everything
* an outlet can be a prompt, "pixel art" or "pottery aesthetics" or "science fiction"
* how to design good outlets?
    * public/visible
    * limited in scope
* "i have nothing to say" — no, you just don't have an outlet for all the things you might say — upon reflection, there's always something to say (whether or not it's worth saying is another question)
    * it's not that the well has dried up, it's that it evaporates if it stays stagnant
    * flowing water is a age-old metaphor for creative work

> … to put it another way, by Whitman's assumptions, we lose that life which remains unarticulated. This is why the family prizes the child with the mouthpiece (sometimes—not all families want to live!), or why a nation prizes its poets (sometimes).

> We must remember why we are working: because craft needs objectives, effort needs purpose, and we need an outlet for our song. — Frank Chimero, _Shape of Design_

* something like a book requires creating the outlet at the same time as the work itself → even the idea of "I'm making a book" can become an outlet, but before it's in that phase, it's nebulous, purposeless or formless

* maybe this is why making leads to more making, because you spill over from one outlet to another. ideas you have don't fit into one medium, so you make a new outlet to explore them. childish gambino writing, acting, and producing music


* story-based example?
    * caleb and his artella experience. He knew he could do sound design, but it just took him finding the right community to have a place to pour those talents into.
    * me and the YSDN admin website, building a custom CMS
    * me and poketo, poketo was my venue to explore building a react app, redux
    * me having things to say about my working-holiday visa time, and making a newsletter
    * jared and renga, trying to build up a company to work on things with friends
    * Wes Anderson and the Wilson brothers didn't have any films to make so they started to write their own
    * Matt Damon didn't have any roles, so he wrote his own script, his own venue, _Good Will Hunting_ to advance his acting.

* do we have a responsibility to create outlets for others?

* definition boundaries
    * is work outside of an outlet art? is work within an outlet design?
    * what's the difference between an outlet and a project?
        * project is one-off, outlet is one-off or ongoing
        * a project is an outlet, but not all outlets are projects
    * what's the difference between an outlet and a team of people?
    * is a prompt an outlet?
        * prompts and outlets are both frameworks, but a prompt is different than an outlet.

* Outlets aren't limited only to work.
    * Communities need effective outlets. In talking with my friend Michelle, we theorized that the most closely-knit communities have (at minimum) three kinds of outlets:
        * (a) a venue to consume together (eat food, watch movies, go to an event, play board games)
        * (b) a venue to make things together (art, food, experiences)
        * (c) a venue to labour together (school, cooperatives)

Infrastructure / Support Systems / Community
* "the most meaningful human activity boils down to providing a support structure for one another", https://mobile.twitter.com/edouerd/status/943151812147892224
* "E.g. The design of the iPhone can only be partially credited to Jonny Ive & team. A significant portion of the design is manifested in Apple’s culture, the constraints of electronics, battery size/duration & the fundamental properties of the various constituent materials that make up the phone, including glass and aluminium, alongside the amortized costs of design, and per unit costs of manufacturing and shipping, and the systems in place to build, maintain & monitor those supply chains." https://www.are.na/block/1574115
* In the world of software, this is why everything is able to be outsourced and marketed. Software for sending emails ()? Software for making surveys (type form)? Software for making surveys specifically towards your users (https://bridge.design/)? Software for making email contact forms (formspree)? Because it's an improvement of the environment.


Does the world need another blog? No. But do _I_ need a blog, to capture and document the outpouring of ideas and feelings I experience daily? I guess.

While _outlets_ is a making-centric way of thinking, people will often defer to more financially oriented ones. A job is an exchange (services for money) or an opportunity. Thinking of a job as an outlet raises different questions: what kind of thing do I want to bring into the world from myself?

* **Teaching a class** is an outlet. It's a space to summarize and distill what you've learned into distinct lessons.
* **A job at a company** is an outlet. The kind of job you do shapes the kinds of outflow you produce. Jobs even give you opportunities to [build your own tools](https://github.com/jongacnik/gr8) to help get your work done. For many people, a job ends up being their primary outlet for creative work.
* **A community** is a powerful outlet. Open-source communities have sparked all sorts of creative contributions, from people who want to give their work to others, or from those who want to give back. Smaller groups like [Learning Gardens](https://learning-gardens.co), [Peer-to-Peer Web](https://peer-to-peer-web.com), or my friend Michelle's _Dream Machine_.
* **A company** is an outlet. In starting a company, people gain a widely available venue to iterate on a product, set of services, brand, and so on. Companies often draw an unanticipated set of skills out of people, like accounting and people management. [this might deserve it's own section]
* **A meeting** is often an outlet. Once at [Watsi](https://watsi.org) in advance of big project we were starting, we had a  ["pre-mortem"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-mortem) to collect ideas of how the project might fail and think of how we could prevent them. In creating a space for people to ask that question of themselves,
* **A sketchbook or journal**. A sketchbook is an outlet. The purpose of its form is to be a dumping ground for ideas and drawings. A journal acts the same way — simply having the space to write about your day can be the starting point to recording and reflecting on it.
