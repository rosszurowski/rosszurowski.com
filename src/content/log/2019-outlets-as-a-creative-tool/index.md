An _outlet_ is a creative tool I often think about.

People commonly use the term, but as a quick expression rather than as a substantial concept. I've yet to hear this mental model be articulated, so let me try to do a little exegesis below.

### What is it?

An outlet is a venue for creative output. It's a place to put things you make. 

This sounds innocuous, but having a place to put things is important. Having a place to put creative work gives you a _reason_ to make creative work.

People who have a venue to publish photos will tend to take more photos. People who have a place to publish writing will tend to finish more pieces of writing. People who have friends to cook for will cook more meals.

If someone asked you to prepare a lesson for a class on a topic you know, you'd quickly find

Creating an effective place for creative work to realize itself is almost more work than the work itself.

A blog is an easy example. I'm always amazed at how much friends of mine know, but without a place to put it, it often stays locked up inside their head. A blog is like an open tap — all the ideas floating around in your head finally have a place to land on their own. Not tied into other projects, but in their own right.

A common example of such an outlet is an Instagram account. People have been casually snapping photos ever since the [fact check!] first cheap commercial films became available in the 1950s. But the "outlet" for these photos was often a family photo album. In this way, the camera would come out at special occasions: birthdays, holidays, family vacations. The family photo album shaped the subject of photography (family!) and who did the photographing (parents! tourists!).

Now, with Instagram as an outlet, millions of people who would otherwise be uninterested in photography are actively engaged in the culture around it. Not only do they take [more photos than ever before](#), but having a singular venue for their photos refine the kinds of photos they take, optimizing their photos for the small screens of phones.[^1]

By having an Instagram account, the photography is drawn out of you.

The destination of the work _inspires_ and _shapes_ what you make. That's why it's more than just a destination. When used intentionally, it can actually be a creative tool.

In a sense, an outlet is like an unanswered question. It's an opening or kind of [framework](https://shapeofdesignbook.com/chapters/03-improvisation-and-limitations/) that draws something out of a space.

The same way a good question makes a space for conversations and ideas from a group of people, an outlet makes a space for certain kind of work.

Outlets are a loose idea and take many forms. They can be described as a destination, but they aren't always a spatial one (as much as virtual spaces can be considered spatial). Outlets can also be:

* **Social**. Having a child to care for is a venue to practice cooking, teaching, singing, playing.
* **Temporal**. A weekly jam session with friends is the formative outlet for many bands. Doing a weekly lecture is an outlet to summarize and distill ideas into distinct lessons.
* **Physical**. 

Under these set of restrictions you can imagine a whole range of outlets:

* **Teaching a class** is an outlet. It's a space to summarize and distill what you've learned into distinct lessons.
* **A job at a company** is an outlet. The kind of job you do shapes the kinds of outflow you produce. Jobs even give you opportunities to [build your own tools](https://github.com/jongacnik/gr8) to help get your work done. For many people, a job ends up being their primary outlet for creative work.
* **A community** is a powerful outlet. Open-source communities have sparked all sorts of creative contributions, from people who want to give their work to others, or from those who want to give back. Smaller groups like [Learning Gardens](https://learning-gardens.co), [Peer-to-Peer Web](https://peer-to-peer-web.com), or my friend Michelle's _Dream Machine_.
* **A company** is an outlet. In starting a company, people gain a widely available venue to iterate on a product, set of services, brand, and so on. Companies often draw an unanticipated set of skills out of people, like accounting and people management. [this might deserve it's own section]
* **A meeting** is often an outlet. Once at [Watsi](https://watsi.org) in advance of big project we were starting, we had a  ["pre-mortem"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-mortem) to collect ideas of how the project might fail and think of how we could prevent them. In creating a space for people to ask that question of themselves, 
* **A sketchbook or journal**. A sketchbook is an outlet. The purpose of its form is to be a dumping ground for ideas and drawings. A journal acts the same way — simply having the space to write about your day can be the starting point to recording and reflecting on it.

In a sense, the best way to get better at a certain kind of work seems to be to craft your own outlet for it.

People who produce the most interesting work are often the product of the diversity of their outlets. After all, making exposes you to the [adjacent possibles](https://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/09/28/the-adjacent-possible.html) in any field, so choosing your outlets determines the futures you're working towards.

While _outlets_ is a making-centric way of thinking, people will often defer to more financially oriented ones. A job is an exchange (services for money) or an opportunity. Thinking of a job as an outlet raises different questions: what kind of thing do I want to bring into the world from myself?

### Origins of Outlets

> We lose that life which remains unarticulated.<br />
> — Lewis Hyde, _The Gift_

For most people, I'd guess that many outlets in our life are made by others:

* A literature club at school that publishes a magazine gives you an outlet to explore printing techniques, page design methods, .
* A project at work gives you an outlet to practice
* A friend starting a business who needs branding work done.

When those outlets disappear (for whatever reason), it leaves a gap in what we make. If you're like me, the disappearance of those outlets trickles into how you feel about yourself.

For myself, graduating design school in 2016 meant the loss of many outlets. In school, I'd have classes on topics I really enjoy, but otherwise sit at the periphery of my interests: type design, branding, communication design. The visual focus of those classes also gave me a chance to explore all sorts of media: calligraphy, laser cutting, suminagashi marbling, screen printing, origami, etc.

These days, my work is heavily software-focused, concerned more with architecture than appearance, structure rather than style. I love it, but I also miss the artistic exploration of those classes. As much as I enjoyed my school's type design classes, without any outlet to draw the work out of me, I haven't once opened up a font editor in the 3 years since school has ended. In fact, doing a Masters' degree sounds compelling to me for this reason — it's a chance to once again explore a set of outlets that I've only found in a school setting.

I'm hardly limited to these things. Nothing stops me from sitting down and cranking out a new typeface (other than a sense of perfectionism, perhaps). But without having a place to publish it to, with nothing drawing that kind of work out of me, it disappears.

Perhaps because outlets are a certain kind of framework. An outlet is a context that work needs to fit into. It provides a structure of what's allowed and what isn't, narrowing the range of possible options to something more manageable, like a prompt.

But especially in our first twenty years of life, so many outlets are given to us that it's easy to forget there's a craft to making our own.

### Designing an Outlet

If it's true that having the effective outlets is as important as the work itself, it's worth some time to examine the craft of producing good ones. 

While it's easy to open an Instagram account or YouTube channel, it takes skill to know where and when an outlet is needed, and how to frame it in productive ways.

As my friends and I of mine look to create our own outlets of various shapes and sizes, it's interesting to see what tends to work and what doesn't:

* Hooking into an existing structures (communities) is much easier. Finding a job, joining up with an existing community. Creating your own structures (company, community) is much harder. The latter, however often gives you more freedom and feels more meaningful.
* Name your outlets! Often times, even the act of giving a name to a set of experiments is enough to form it into an outlet. Sometimes, simply registering a domain and naming a project can be enough of a push to formalize the outlet and make it happen. But don't get caught up in it.


As vague as the term "outlet" can be, it feels important to articulate. Because when you articulate the idea, you can begin to study them. Are they good ones? Bad ones? Are they given to us? Or are there some still missing that we need to make for ourselves?

"an outlet for his energy"
"a channel or a conduit"

* outlets as a tool for doing creative work
* having a place for creativity to realize itself is almost more of the work than "being creative." Creating a space for yourself or others to be creative cultivates a creative spirit. Start a personal project, a blog, a community art group, etc.
* an outlet is like a question, it draws out an answer from an otherwise uninteresting space. it promotes a curiosity
* "a forcing function"
* plants and roots drawing water up out of the soil, capillary action
* examples of outlets
    * markets are a great outlet (I have no interest in selling something, instagram, bandcamp, youtube)
    * communities of people working on projects (dream machine, learning gardens, are.na community, p2p web community, open source community, renga, a personal site)
    * an event, a concert
    * an app, an ongoing project
    * a team, a job
    * an invitation to speak at a conference, teach a class
    * tumblr is an outlet, an outlet for curation and vibe collection
    * meetings at a start-up, fears or issues about a project, having the right meeting to draw those out can change things
    * musicians, idly jamming until themes emerge, and it forms into an album. the album and theme behind the album is the focusing outlet that draws it into a cohesive whole
    * Craig Mod's _Koya Bound_
* kinds of outlets
    * social (a community, a meeting, a friendship)
    * temporal (an event, a concert, a weekly jam session)
    * conceptual (a prompt, an idea)
    * physical (a sketchbook)
* some outlets are self-made, some are made by others
    * many are provided for us, or come to us
        * a club at school
        * a project at work
        * a friend starting a business
    * it's easy to forget that there's a craft to making our own
* having a place to put something draws it out of you
* people who have a place to publish photos… will take more photos
* people who have a place to write… will finish more pieces of writing
* people who have others to cook for… will tend to cook more
* people who are writing a book, you have a place to put ideas about a topic
* even a friendship can be an outlet, albeit an ever-changing one. an emotional outlet, but also a topical outlet (i talk about starting a business with jared)
* "what you don't express will destroy you"
* leaving school and losing various outlets was hard
    * i lost an outlet for print design, type design, cultural studies
    * this is why doing a masters degree is so compelling, it's a chance to restore once lost outlets
* an outlet is a focused space that requests something of you
* an outlet is limited, it's a playground you move within, it shouldn't be everything
* an outlet can be a prompt, "pixel art" or "pottery aesthetics" or "science fiction"
* how to design good outlets?
    * public/visible
    * limited in scope
* "i have nothing to say" — no, you just don't have an outlet for all the things you might say — upon reflection, there's always something to say (whether or not it's worth saying is another question)
    * it's not that the well has dried up, it's that it evaporates if it stays stagnant
    * flowing water is a age-old metaphor for creative work

> … to put it another way, by Whitman's assumptions, we lose that life which remains unarticulated. This is why the family prizes the child with the mouthpiece (sometimes—not all families want to live!), or why a nation prizes its poets (sometimes).
> — Lewis Hyde, _The Gift_

> We must remember why we are working: because craft needs objectives, effort needs purpose, and we need an outlet for our song. — Frank Chimero, _Shape of Design_

> If you bring forth what is inside of you, what you bring forth will save you. If you don’t bring forth what is inside of you, what you bring forth can destroy you. — Bird by Bird

* why are outlets so important?
* an effective community needs a few different outlets:
    * consumes together (eg. eats)
    * makes together (eg. cooks, makes art)
    * labours together

* something like a book requires creating the outlet at the same time as the work itself → even the idea of "I'm making a book" can become an outlet, but before it's in that phase, it's nebulous, purposeless or formless

* maybe this is why making leads to more making, because you spill over from one outlet to another. ideas you have don't fit into one medium, so you make a new outlet to explore them. childish gambino writing, acting, and producing music


* story-based example?
    * caleb and his artella experience. He knew he could do sound design, but it just took him finding the right community to have a place to pour those talents into.
    * me and the YSDN admin website, building a custom CMS
    * me and poketo, poketo was my venue to explore building a react app, redux
    * me having things to say about my working-holiday visa time, and making a newsletter
    * jared and renga, trying to build up a company to work on things with friends
    * Wes Anderson and the Wilson brothers didn't have any films to make so they started to write their own
    * Matt Damon didn't have any roles, so he wrote his own script, his own venue, _Good Will Hunting_ to advance his acting.

* do we have a responsibility to create outlets for others?

* definition boundaries
    * is work outside of an outlet art? is work within an outlet design?
    * what's the difference between an outlet and a project?
        * project is one-off, outlet is one-off or ongoing
        * a project is an outlet, but not all outlets are projects
    * what's the difference between an outlet and a team of people?
    * is a prompt an outlet?
        * prompts and outlets are both frameworks, but a prompt is different than an outlet.



Does the world need another blog? No. But do _I_ need a blog, to capture and document the outpouring of ideas and feelings I experience daily? I guess.
