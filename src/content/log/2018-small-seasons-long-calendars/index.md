I visited Toronto this past January, with winter in full force. Walking through the wind tunnel that is the downtown core, I didn't think I'd miss my face being blasted by high-speed frigid air. But here I am, five months later with an odd longing for seasons.

San Francisco is a city of eternal mild weather: trees never lose their leaves, and temperatures are consistently in the "sweater" range, save for a few days in early fall. It's so "pleasant."

But it's not the shitty Canadian winters that I miss, so much as the natural division that seasons bring to the year. Living in a seasonless city changes how I think about time. Between work, travel, and a few personal projects, weeks pass by in an instant. I've been here for almost three years, but it's only felt like a couple months.

### Calendars

Recently I've been thinking a bit about memory and journaling. In this time, I've grown an interest in calendars.

Calendars are one of humanity's oldest and most important thinking tools. The calendar, like written language, enables a greater degree of coordination and control as a society. A society that has a collectively standardized view of time can know when to expect certain weather, can talk about the future, can make deadlines and define work weeks.

There's no shortage of writing on the impact of our mechanization of time, but McLuhan's is particularly concise:

> The clock dragged man out of the world of seasonal rhythms and recurrence, as effectively as the alphabet had released him from the magical resonance of the spoken word and the tribal trap. This dual translation of the individual out of the grip of Nature and out of the clutch of the tribe was not without its own penalties.

Clocks and calendars provide a language for describing time. And like all forms of language, it introduces metaphors and patterns that shape how we divide our time and think about our lives.

We see this in business all the time. My roommates come home from work at larger tech companies frustrated, feeling like they can't make meaningful progress because their work is constrained to the current fiscal quarter. The cadence for projects is too short to bring any holistic change.

The inverse happens every New Year's Eve. People set resolutions that are achievable within a year, but as the days pass, it's easy to lose yourself in how quickly they go by. "The days are long but the years are short." Goals set on too long of a timeframe become nebulous or intangible, disconnected from everyday experience.

Both of these experiences point to, in part, a failure of how we conceptualize and represent time.

The rigidity of standardized calendars[^1] works great for accounting, communication, and coordination, but fails at more personal functions, such as journaling, chunking out work, or cycles of interest and curiosity.

### From 2 weeks to 100 years

A friend of mine has a creative way of journaling. He takes moments from his life, documenting them via a mishmash of different media, and groups them into discrete "phases." Each "phase" is roughly two weeks long, give or take, and is a collection of words, events, ideas, screenshots, and interests. It's a great way to remember things. In conversations, a topic or feeling will come up, only for him to say, "oh man, that was _so_ phase 37." By chunking his life out into two-week phases it becomes easier to grasp, both in language and in memory.

Contrast that with a more standard journaling experience: writing words on a daily basis. At the end of a year, you look back on a sea of thousands of words, unfiltered and uncategorized. So much is written down that it's hard to extract anything meaningful from it, short of jumping around to specific moments. The frequency of making is too short, but the frequency of review is too long.

It's not limited to journaling. Think about another function of calendars: scheduling. You open up iCal and you get a view of the next 7 days. You can block out the next 168 hours of your life in chunks of 30 minute events. But unless your day consists of a long series of [back-to-back 30 minute meetings with others](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html), does this interface make sense? Do most people actually live that way? Also, you can page through time endlessly forwards or endlessly backwards. How does this infinite spectrum affect how we think?

In contrast, James Fisher's [long calendar idea](https://jameshfisher.com/2017/06/06/long-calendar) sounds really compelling:

> How long will you be in your current house? How do you plan out your thirties? When will you move to Spain, as you’ve always imagined you would? When might you have your first child, and what job would you like to aim for by then? […]
>
> These life questions require a different kind of calendar. These questions operate on a different timescale, where the month is probably the most granular unit of time you might want. These questions work on a personal human epoch — “I am 29”, not “it is 2017.”

You can imagine more questions on this train of thought:

- What does a community calendar look like? How can it afford community action and collective identity?
- How can calendars encourage thinking beyond our own lifespans? (Peter Bïlak's [100-year calendar](https://www.typotheque.com/posters/the_100-year_calendar) is an interesting example of this)

### Small Seasons

In Kenya Hara's book _White_, he dedicates a brief section to talk about _sekki_, small seasons used back in agricultural China and Japan which divided the year. Each sekki corresponded to a shift in the climate, with poetic language to match the changes.

Where spring is our "large" season, lasting roughly from March to June, the sekki calendar breaks it down into six small seasons: _start of spring_, _rain waters_, _the going-out of the worms_, _vernal equinox_, _clear and bright_, and _rain for harvests_. Both describe the same period of time, but one does so with a precision that feels much more human.

Like my friend's "phases," two weeks feels like an appropriate amount of time to use as a calendar. These days, I increasingly find myself using sekki as a calendar, matching my own ebb and flow of interest, attention, and general mental headspace. It's also nice to have a form of calendar so explicitly based on the surrounding environment; you're encouraged to look up and notice that the crickets are no longer chirping and that time has gone by.

Sekki are one example, but more broadly, there's merit to finding new abstractions for breaking time down in more human ways. Especially in a day with such powerful means to create new representations and language with computers, why have we not developed more personal calendaring practices?

The more language we have at our disposal to think about how time passes, the more finely we can conceive of and think about our lives.
