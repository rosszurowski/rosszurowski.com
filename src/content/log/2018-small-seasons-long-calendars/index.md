Recently, I felt an odd longing for seasons.

San Francisco is a city that feels like time doesn't pass. Trees never lose their leaves, and it barely ever rains. Even when windy, it's always pleasant enough for visitors to comment.

But after coming home from Toronto â€¦

I miss the early winter morning drives to Mount Joy GO Station, the fields blanketed with snow. The car covered with ice, while I'd sit inside and listen to the radio, wondering if I wouldn't be on time for my connecting bus. Or the summer nights in Altona, hanging with the Calebs, humid temperatures and synthesizer jams. Maybe a late-night David Lynch movie too.

Living in a season-less city makes it feel like time passes too quickly. Between work, a bit of travel, and a few personal projects, weeks pass by in instants. I've been here for almost two years, but it might as well have been a couple months.

I don't just miss the times I associate with the seasons, and I also miss how the seasons marked the time. They were a natural way of chunking out memories and experiences.

Over the past few months, as I've been reflecting on memory, journaling, and thinking tools, I've grown interested in calendars. Calendars are one of humanity's most important thinking tools [more details here]

> Something about almanac's and the history of calendars.

Ways we think about our time has affects on how we think about our lives.

We see this in business all the time. My roommates come home from work at larger companies, complaining how they feel like they can't do anything meaningful because their work is constrained to the current financial quarter.

The same thing happens every New Year's, where people set resolutions that are achievable within a year, but as the weeks come along, it's easy to lose yourself in how quickly they pass.

I think both of these things are a failure of our tools to conceptualize time. If we conceive of a year as 12 months, we'll set goals or plan events based on how much time is in the year.

[include bits about Taylorism and Fordism]

A friend of mine has a creative way of journaling. He takes photos from moments throughout the day and groups them into "phases." Each "phase" is about two weeks, and consists not only of two weeks worth of events, but ideas, screenshots, interests, frustrations, etc. It's a great way to remember things. In conversations, a topic or feeling will come up, only for him to say, "oh man, that was _so_ phase 37." By chunking the year out into two-week phases it becomes easier to grasp, both in language and in memory.

You open up Google Calendar and you get a view of only the current 7 days.

James Fisher's [long calendar idea](https://jameshfisher.com/2017/06/06/long-calendar) becomes really compelling: how can we design representations of time that are more human? What are the implications of the thinking tools we make?

In Kenya Hara's book _White_, he dedicates a brief section to talk about _sekki_, small seasons used back in agricultural China and Japan which divided the year. Each sekki corresponded to a shift in the climate, with poetic language to match the changes.

Where spring is our "large" season, the sekki calendar breaks it down into _start of spring_, _rain waters_, _the going-out of the worms_, _vernal equinox_, _clear and bright_, and _rain for harvests_. Both describe the same period of time, but one does so with a precision that feels much more human.

I find myself increasingly using sekki as a calendar.

I think calendars are one of those fundamental pieces of language that have resulted in some mis-fit over time with our changing contexts. We need more calendars for different purposes. Personal computers, personal calendars.

Seasons are the world reminding us that time keeps passing and that life is moving on. And I think part of living life more meaningfully is thinking about the time that passes in better ways.
