Recently, I felt an odd longing for seasons.

San Francisco has only two seasons: pleasant and pleasant with fog. Trees keep their leaves year-round, and temperatures are consistently in the sweater-weather range. It's the city of eternal mild weather.

This past Christmas I went back to Toronto when winter was in full force. My phone told me it was -30°C. The downtown core was like a wind tunnel, blasting my face with high-speed frigid air. _Why does anyone put up with this?_ I thought. But here I am, five months later, sitting in the California sun, longing for some shittier weather.

It's not the Canadian winters that I miss, so much as the natural division seasons bring to the year. Living in a seasonless city makes time move at a scary pace like how, as a kid, summer vacation would end before you know it. Between work, travel, and a few personal projects, weeks pass by in an instant. I've been here for almost three years, but it's only felt like a couple months.

### Old Calendars

Recently I’ve been thinking a bit about memory, journaling, and calendars.

Calendars are one of humanity’s most important thinking tools. Informal ones are as old as argicultural society itself. From the days of farming, it was important to know when to plough, to seed, to harvest and when to let fields lie fallow. Even as socities grew, it became important to have collective standards for time, so you can know when to expect certain weather, demarcate religious days, or even just talk about the future.

There’s no shortage of writing on the impact of our mechanization of time, but McLuhan is particularly concise:

> The clock [or calendar, in our case] dragged man out of the world of seasonal rhythms and recurrence, as effectively as the alphabet had released him from the magical resonance of the spoken word and the tribal trap. This dual translation of the individual out of the grip of Nature and out of the clutch of the tribe was not without its own penalties.

Much like written language, the calendar enables a greater degree of coordination and control as a society. And also like written language, calendars introduce metaphors and patterns of thought which then affect how we live. Some obvious ones: The week, the month, the year, the financial quarter, the nine-to-five.

These divisions of time guide or life and work, but can often feel quite arbitrary. For instance, I've seen this in work at larger companies. My roommates come home from work frustrated with their projects, feeling like they can't make meaningful progress because their work is constrained to the current fiscal quarter. The short cadence encourages them to build something that caters to easy metrics rather than bring any holistic change. The chunks are too small.

The inverse happens every New Year's Eve. People set resolutions that are achievable within a year, but as the days pass, it's easy to lose yourself in how quickly they go by. The cadence is too long. And goals set on too long of a cadence become disconnected from everyday experience, nebulous and intangible.

These examples point to, in part, two major failures of how we conceptualize and represent time.

1. They force us into arbitrary timescales.
2. They don't create meaningful divisions of time.

The rigidity of standardized calendars is no doubt great for accounting, communication, and coordination[^1] but fails at more personal functions, such as journaling, creating a deep dedication to your life's work, or maintaining cycles of interest and curiosity.

### From 2 weeks

A friend of mine has a creative way of journaling.

He documents moments from his life via a mishmash of words, events, ideas, and screenshots, and groups them into discrete _phases_. Each phase is roughly two weeks long, defined not by the days of the month, but by his living situation and activities. A week-long bike trip across Southern Europe might be one phase, but two months of a deep heads-down focus on school work could be another. Each phase is a discrete period of his life.

It's a great way to remember things. In conversations, a topic or feeling will come up, only for him to say, "oh man, that was _so_ phase 37." By chunking his life out into phases it becomes easier to grasp, both in language and in memory.

Contrast that with a more standard journaling experience: writing 500 words on every few days. At the end of a year, you look back on a sea of thousands of words, unfiltered and uncategorized. So much is written down that it's hard to extract anything meaningful from it without jumping around to specific moments. The frequency of making is too short, but the frequency of review is too long.

### To a lifetime

It's not limited to journaling. Think of another function of calendars: planning.

You open up iCal and you get a view of the next 7 days. You can block out the next 168 hours of your life in chunks of 30 minute events. But unless your life is a long series of [back-to-back 30 minute meetings](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) with others, does this interface make sense? Do most people actually live that way?

In contrast, James Fisher's [long calendar idea](https://jameshfisher.com/2017/06/06/long-calendar) sounds really compelling:

> How long will you be in your current house? How do you plan out your thirties? When will you move to Spain, as you’ve always imagined you would? When might you have your first child, and what job would you like to aim for by then? […]
>
> These life questions require a different kind of calendar. They operate on a different timescale, where the month is probably the most granular unit of time you might want. These questions work on a personal human epoch — “I am 29”, not “it is 2017.”

How might seeing your whole life, laid out on a single calendar affect how you live and plan?

### Small Seasons

In Kenya Hara's book _White_, he briefly talks about _sekki_, small seasons used in ancient agricultural China and Japan to divide the year. Each sekki corresponds to a shift in the climate, with poetic language to match the changes.

Where spring is our "large" season, lasting roughly from March to June, the sekki calendar breaks it down into six small seasons: _start of spring_, _rain waters_, _the going-out of the worms_, _vernal equinox_, _clear and bright_, and _rain for harvests_.[^2] Both describe a similar period of time, but one does so with a precision that feels much more human.

These days, I increasingly find myself using sekki as a calendar for my own phases.

On one hand, it's nice to have a form of calendar so explicitly based on the surrounding environment; you’re encouraged to look up and notice what's different today, that the crickets are no longer chirping and that time has gone by.

But it also better matches my own ebb and flow of interest, attention, and general mental headspace. Two weeks of deep work on something is all I can reasonably maintain before wanting to move to a different aspect, or a new project all together.

### And others

Sekki, phases, and the long calendar are just a few examples of how we can design more human and purposeful calendaring systems. Heck, even [a seasonal vegetable chart](https://cuesa.org/eat-seasonally/charts/vegetables) for an area is wonderfully tangible alternate calendar. Why can't your calendar be a tool to help you decide when to make a minestrone soup, oxtail stew, or a pico de gallo?

You can imagine some bigger questions along the same train of thought:

- How might calendars inspire or inform daily living?
- What does a community calendar look like? How can it afford community action and collective identity?
- How might calendars encourage thinking beyond our own lifespans? (Peter Bïlak's [100-year calendar](https://www.typotheque.com/posters/the_100-year_calendar) is an interesting example of this)

Especially in an era with such powerful means to create new representations of time, it seems like there's something valuable in breaking time down in more human ways. The more language we have at our disposal to think about how time passes, the more finely we can conceive of and think about our lives.

  The value of standardized calendars is not lost on me. Having recently experienced the joys of working with [the Ethiopian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_calendar), I'm all for alignment to standards when communicating with others.
