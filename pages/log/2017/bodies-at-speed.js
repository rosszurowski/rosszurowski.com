Earlier this year, Elon Musk [announced he got verbal approval](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/888053175155949572) to build an underground Hyperloop between New York and D.C.

Travel is one of those perennial human problems, and over the years we've devised [increasingly complex solutions](https://techrato.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the_boring_company_concept_3.gif) to move people and things from one place to another. Bikes, trains, cars, planes, and now roller-coasters inside tunnels. Each new approach lets us travel quicker than before, but also requires more maintenance, safety equipment, and regulations.

In university I was introduced to the writings of Paul Virilio, a French cultural theorist. One of his most known ideas is [the integral accident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Virilio#The_integral_accident), which is often summarized in this quote:

> When you invent the ship, you also invent the shipwreck; when you invent the plane you also invent the plane crash.

It's a meaty idea that digs into humanity's infatuation with technology. But when I hear it, all I can ever think is what it means for objects moving at high speeds.

Moving faster _inherently_ creates more risk. Even when the risks are well-controlled (plane rides are statistically safer than driving, right?) they are never gone. A rocket will always have more dangerous _potential_ than a car.

Greater velocity equals greater consequences when things go wrong. There's no getting around that nature, no matter how many safeguards you implement.

Itâ€™s always interesting to see innovative approaches to age old problems. But, in my head, complex solutions never seem [quite as appropriate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriate_technology) as ways to use simpler ones, like walking, biking, and creating more dense urban spaces.
